# Restaurant-Backend
This project is built using Node.js and MongoDB to provide a secure and efficient system for managing restaurant bookings.

## Environment Setup
The project is built using Node.js and requires dependencies such as Express and Mongoose. MongoDB is used as the database for storing information, and sensitive data is managed using environment variables stored in a `.env` file.

## API Design
The backend follows a RESTful API architecture with endpoints for user registration, restaurant search, reservation management, and admin operations. Role-based access control ensures secure API interactions, allowing users to book reservations while enabling admins to manage restaurant details and analyze reservation trends.

## Database Schema
The database is structured using MongoDB, with the following key schemas:
- **Users:** Contains user details, roles (admin or regular user), and authentication credentials.
- **Restaurants:** Stores restaurant information, including name, location, cuisine, available slots, menu, and reviews.
- **Reservations:** Tracks reservations with user ID, restaurant ID, date, time, and payment status.
- **Reviews:** Allows users to leave ratings and comments for restaurants.

## Authentication and Authorization
User authentication is handled using JWT or OAuth, ensuring secure login and role-based access. Regular users can search for restaurants and manage their reservations, while admins have extended permissions to manage restaurant data and reservation slots.

## Reservation Management
The reservation system allows users to create, view, edit, and cancel bookings. A calendar-based slot management feature ensures availability and prevents double bookings through conflict handling mechanisms.

## Admin Dashboard Features
Admins can manage restaurant data, update reservation slots, and analyze booking trends through dedicated API endpoints. The system also provides data for visual representation of trends in the UI.

## Notifications
Push notifications are integrated using Firebase or similar services to keep users informed about reservation updates, confirmations, and restaurant announcements. Admins receive alerts for new reservations and modifications.

## Payment Integration
A secure payment gateway such as Stripe or PayPal is integrated for processing payments. Compliance with security standards like PCI DSS ensures safe transactions.

## Feedback and Reviews
Users can submit reviews and ratings through dedicated endpoints, allowing restaurants to gather customer feedback and display it on their profile pages.

## Mobile Responsiveness
The backend is optimized for mobile use by supporting responsive designs and implementing efficient data handling techniques such as pagination to reduce mobile data consumption.

## Testing
Comprehensive unit and integration testing is performed to ensure reliability. Tools like Postman and Swagger are used for API validation, along with robust error handling and logging mechanisms for debugging.

## Documentation
API documentation is provided using tools like Swagger or Postman. Additionally, setup and deployment instructions are included, along with user guides for the admin dashboard and reservation system features.

## Deployment
The backend is deployed on cloud hosting services like AWS, Heroku, or Azure. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate testing and deployment, while monitoring tools like New Relic and Sentry track real-time errors and system performance.

This backend infrastructure ensures a seamless and efficient restaurant reservation experience, balancing security, usability, and performance.
